The following is based on a tip from Matthew Reidsma at Grand Valley State University Libraries.
https://github.com/gvsulib/Summon-Stats#adding-the-script-to-summon

To add a custom script to Summon, go to the Summon Admin Console > Settings.

Scroll down to the Custom Link section.

In the URL field, enter "#" (without quotes)

In the Text field, enter the following:

```

<script src="http://path/to/your/script" type="text/javascript"></script>

```

Just update the path to the location where you have placed your summon-tweak.js file

After saving your changes, it may take several minutes (about 10 mins for me) for the change to take effect.
